# teamspeak-scripts
A collection of scripts to help manage TeamSpeak. The scripts aren't intelligent, and may say they've done something when they haven't. If you plan on using them, that's fine, but make sure they work for you before assuming they've actually done anything.

# Executing
Don't forget to make the files executable.
```chmod +x ./teamspeak-setup-install.sh```
